# My dotfiles

Based on the following [article](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) as graciously suggested by [Mathias Lafeldt](https://www.github.com/mlafeldt/).

#### Installation

1. Install `stow` for your operating system.
2. Clone the repository into your home directory -> `~/dotfiles`.
3. Switch to the `dotfiles` directory.
4. Run `stow <subdir>` to create symlinks for that particular software.
